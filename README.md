# Predictive-revenue
This project provides a comprehensive solution for financial time series forecasting, specifically focusing on revenue prediction. It utilizes an XGBoost model, integrates with a Flask web application for interactive forecasting, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and saves predictions and visualizations.

### Features

* **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts future revenue values using an Regressor model trained on historical financial data.
* **Interactive Web Interface**: A Flask application allows users to specify the number of days for future predictions and visualize the forecast results.
* **Automated Data Processing**: Includes utilities for loading financial data from a CSV (`deutsche_bank_financial_performance.csv`) and scaling it for model input.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performs basic EDA on the dataset, including shape, missing values, and summary statistics, which are printed to the console upon application run.
* **Results Export and Visualization**: Forecasted data is saved to an Excel file (`output/forecasted_financial_data.xlsx`), and a plot showing actual vs. forecasted values is generated and saved as a PNG image (`static/financial_forecast.png`).
* **Modular Design**: Separates concerns into distinct modules for data utilities (`utils.py`), model training (`train_model.py`), forecasting logic (`forecast.py`), and the main application (`main.py` and `app1.py`).

### Requirements

The application relies on the following Python libraries:

* **Python 3.x**
* **Flask**: For building the web application.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and reading/writing CSV and Excel files.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations, especially with scaled data and sequences.
* **Matplotlib**: For generating plots of actual vs. forecasted data.
* **XGBoost**: The core machine learning library used for forecasting.
* **scikit-learn**: Specifically `MinMaxScaler` for data scaling.
* **`joblib`**: (Likely used implicitly by XGBoost or for model persistence, although explicit `joblib.dump`/`load` might be in `train_model.py` for `scaler` or `model` if `xgboost` saves its model differently). `xgboost` models can save/load via `model.save_model` and `model.load_model` directly, which is seen in `forecast.py`.
* **`openpyxl`**: (Implicitly required by Pandas for Excel `.xlsx` file operations).

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Place your dataset**: Ensure your time series dataset, named `deutsche_bank_financial_performance.csv`, is located in a `data/` directory within your project root. It should contain a 'Date' column and a numeric column (e.g., 'Revenue') for forecasting.

2.  **Create `requirements.txt`**: Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project root with the following content:
    ```
    Flask
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    xgboost
    scikit-learn
    openpyxl
    ```

3.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Train the XGBoost Model**: Run the `train_model.py` script once to train the XGBoost model and save it as `models/xgb_model.json`. This will create the `models/` directory if it doesn't exist.
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

6.  **Run the Flask Application**:
    ```bash
    python app1.py
    ```
    This will start the Flask development server. EDA summary will be printed to your console.

### Usage

1.  **Access the Web Interface**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2.  **Input Prediction Days**: On the home page, enter the number of future days/periods you wish to forecast.
3.  **View Forecast**: Submit the form. The application will perform the forecast, generate a plot, save the numerical results to `output/forecasted_financial_data.xlsx`, and display the forecast plot on the results page.
4.  **Review EDA**: The EDA summary will be printed in the console where you ran `app1.py`.
5.  **Download Results**: You can download the `forecasted_financial_data.xlsx` file
